Over the next six months, you’re going to cover a lot of ground as you gain the skills to land your first job as a data scientist. It’s going to be as challenging as it is exciting. Here’s what to expect.

#### Your first few days

On your first day in the course, you’ll be **assigned your program manager**. That person will be your go-to person for any issues that arise. You’ll have an orientation call with your program manager in your first few days. You can see who your program manager is in your [home screen](https://dashboard.thinkful.com/).

During your first week, you’ll also be **assigned your mentor** and schedule your first 1-on-1 session.

Together, these two people are the core of your support team. They'll keep you on track and help you establish productive learning habits.

On day one, you’ll **gain access to a set of curricula**.

#### A typical week

In a typical week, you may work on reading assignments, drills, short projects, or capstones. The basic rhythm is: learn about a small set of concepts through reading assignments, practice them with drills and short projects, then demonstrate your mastery of a larger set of concepts in a capstone project.

In order to succeed in this course, you’ll need to **spend 20 to 25 hours each week working on Thinkful**. We recommend that you block out specific Thinkful work times on your calendar and try your best to stick to the schedule you’ve created.


#### Mock interviews

To get a job, you not only need to have the right skills, you also need to perform well in interviews, which is itself a skill that requires practice. Over the first six months of the course, you’ll do 5 mock interviews. These interviews are designed to prepare you for real interviews once you’ve graduated. You’ll get written feedback for each mock interview that you can go over with your mentor to shore up any weak spots in your knowledge.

You’ll be prompted in your home screen to schedule mock interviews at different points in the course. Here’s a breakdown of the interviews:

#### Graduation and job guarantee

By the end of your first six months in the course, your overarching goal is to produce three impressive capstone projects and showcase them in an online portfolio. These projects will demonstrate your mastery of the skills taught in this course, and your portfolio will display your skills to prospective employers.

In order to graduate from the course, gain access to career prep and placement services, and qualify for our job guarantee, you must complete the following requirements within six months of starting:

+ Gain mentor and program manager approval on the three capstone projects in this course (all of these are in the full stack phase):
    - The [API hack project](/web-dev-002v1/uuid/bf9ce4a0-14c6-11e7-a5ff-758d65325205) at the end of the *WEB-DEV-002: Asynchronous web apps* curriculum
    - The [Node fullstack capstone](/node-001v5/uuid/87a04890-a7b0-11e6-97b3-55ffa43d5649) at the end of the *NODE-001: Server-side programming with JavaScript* curriculum
    - The [final fullstack capstone](/fewd-201v4/uuid/98241570-08f9-11e7-b5b4-874a2a9a6455) from the *FEWD-201: Advanced topics* curriculum.

    Note that capstone requirements are discussed in assignment 4 of this curriculum.

+ Gain mentor and program manager approval on the professional portfolio site project, which will showcase your work and experience to prospective employers.
+ Schedule and complete five mock interviews


#### Job Search Phase

After you’ve completed your coursework, you’ll begin an intensive job search phase. During this time, you'll be assigned a career coach, who will help you craft applications that stand out, give you additional interview practice, and be there to help you hustle your way to your first job as a software engineer. You’ll also work with your employer network manager, who will make introductions to companies in your area that would be a good fit. Note that **you no longer pay tuition once you’re in the job search phase**.

#### Keep your eye on the prize

Learning full stack web development in six months is a tall order. Even with all the resources that Thinkful puts in your hands, you are going to have moments of frustration. When you’re feeling particularly challenged, remember why you’re putting in all this work: to land your first job as a software engineer, and for the feeling of pride you will have by gaining a valuable set of skills.
