Your mentor is an amazing resource, but certainly not the only one available. There are several ways for you to connect with the broader Thinkful community of mentors and students.

## Get help from mentors and students on Slack

Make sure to join our community on [Slack](https://thinkful.slack.com/), where you can get access to help in between mentor sessions, as well as chat with students and mentors about everything from the tech industry to the latest episode of Game of Thrones.

Blanche Cohen, a Thinkful mentor, says, "Ask for help as soon as possible. Don't feel awkward or ashamed that you don't get it.” Through Slack, you have access to hundreds of mentors and students who are ready to help. You can always reach out to your mentor over email, but you'll often get a faster response in Slack thanks to the size of this community. If a mentor is helping another student, be patient – it can take 10 or 15 minutes to get help in Slack depending on time of day.

And remember, everyone in the Slack community was a new student once. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Here are some tips for getting helpful responses:

+ Include details about the problem you're encountering.
+ Let the community know what you already tried.
+ Share a link to your code, or share code snippets directly.
+ Don't ask a vague question like "Can someone help with unsupervised learning?". We find most of the time, other people won't speak up because they are afraid they won't be able to help. Ask the whole question, and you’ll get a response more quickly.

Finally, when you see a question on Slack you might know the answer to, jump in and help! Explaining concepts and techniques to someone else is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge (just ask any of our mentors!).


## Attend daily Q&A Sessions for more help

While Slack is great, nothing beats face time with an expert. [Q&A (question & answer) sessions](http://www.thinkful.com/open-sessions/qa-sessions) are held every day, and can cover everything from data science to mobile app design. If you have a specific question, either from your coursework or even a personal project, visit the calendar and RSVP to the next convenient session. And if you just feel like seeing what others are up to, feel free to drop in even if you don’t have a specific question.


## The 30 minute rule

We can say with 99.99% certainty that you will get stuck at different times during this course. How do we know? Because even professional data scientists regularly get stuck; they just happen to be experts in getting unstuck (which is a skill you’ll develop over time). As a newcomer to data science, you’re even more likely to get stuck.

When you get stuck: stop, take a step back, try to articulate the problem first to yourself, and then Google your description of the problem. There’s a good chance that other people have had similar difficulties, and you may find an answer online (especially on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)).

**Being able to hunt down a solution is a key professional skill for data scientists.** At times during the program, you will find that you don't know the answer to a particular drill or the implementation of a certain feature. While you can always use the support mentioned above, we strongly encourage you to hone your researching skills as well. It may sound silly, but many experienced data scientists will tell you that knowing how to Google is essential to their success.

But if after 30 minutes you’re making no progress, then wait no longer to take advantage of Thinkful’s resources and reach out for help. If you have a session in the next day, you can bring up your problem with your mentor and pair on it. You can also bring your problem to a daily [Q&A session](http://www.thinkful.com/open-sessions/qa-sessions) and get help there.

You also should feel free to reach out in the Slack community for help. Clearly state the problem you’ve encountered, and paste any relevant code snippets or error messages for others to see.

While you’re learning with Thinkful, you’re not on your own, and mentors and fellow students can help you work through your problem. Remember, our community is a safe place, and you shouldn’t feel intimidated or embarrassed about reaching out when you’re stuck.
