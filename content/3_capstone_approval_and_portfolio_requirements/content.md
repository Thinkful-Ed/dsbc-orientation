Hiring managers have a high bar for professional work, so we set our standards accordingly. We review each stage of your work with rigor, providing critical feedback along the way. As a result, Thinkful graduates enter the job market with a killer portfolio and project management skills.

## Graduation requirements

In order to graduate, we require that your program manager signs off on your portfolio, including every capstone project you complete. Your program manager (PM) must approve each step in the process outlined in this section.

## Being job-ready

In addition to being a graduation requirement, this approval process puts you in a position to succeed as a job seeker. So, what exactly does job readiness mean?

**You produce high-quality output**

Your biggest strength as an applicant is a track record of usable, aesthetically pleasing, and well-written work. Our PMs and mentor network have a lot of valuable insight into how to make your portfolio stand out.

**You can work on a team**

As a professional data scientist, it’s important to know how to receive and consider critical feedback.

Remember not to take critical feedback personally! It’s easy to get attached to your own ideas, but someone reviewing your work won’t have the same affinity for it that you do. If criticism ever seems harsh, remember that every critique is an opportunity to improve, learn, and grow as a data scientist. Courtesy in response to critical feedback is a clear sign of professionalism.
