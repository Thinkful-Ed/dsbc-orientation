Hiring managers have a high bar for professional work, so we set our standards accordingly. We review each stage of your work with rigor, providing critical feedback along the way. As a result, Thinkful graduates enter the job market with a killer portfolio and project management skills.

#### Graduation Requirements

In order to graduate, we require that your program manager signs off on your portfolio, including every capstone project you complete. Your program manager (PM) must approve each step in the process outlined in this section.

When building a capstone, you’ll submit the following:

**1. Proposal: propose a unique, useful project idea**

Each capstone should solve a specific problem or provide a specific service. You’ll answer questions about your users, the technology you plan to use, and your execution strategy.

**2. Design: wireframe and design your app**

Once your capstone project idea has been approved, submit an HTML mockup of your design. This stage is a sketch, but it should include all UI elements that you’re considering using, and it should show the overall look and feel that you will represent with your final design.

**3. Implementation: build your project**

Bring your plans to life! Follow the technical requirements for building and hosting your project.

Feel free to continue working as you wait for feedback on each step.

#### Being Job-Ready
In addition to being a graduation requirement, this approval process puts you in a position to succeed as a job seeker. So, what exactly does job readiness mean?

**You produce high-quality output**

Your biggest strength as an applicant is a track record of usable, aesthetically pleasing, and well-written work. Our PMs and mentor network have a lot of valuable insight into how to make your portfolio stand out.

**You can work on a team**

As a professional web developer, it’s important to know how to receive and consider critical feedback. You’ll do this often in a professional setting -- collaborative work alongside designers, product managers, and other developers, for example. You’ll have to act on suggestions from clients as a freelancer, and your own users as an entrepreneur.

Remember not to take critical feedback personally! It’s easy to get attached to your own ideas, but someone reviewing your work won’t have the same affinity for it that you do. If criticism ever seems harsh, remember that every critique is an opportunity to improve, learn, and grow as a developer. Courtesy in response to critical feedback is a clear sign of professionalism.

**You have effective project management skills**

It’s equally crucial to establish a habit of planning out your project prior to writing code. This will save you countless hours of reworking your design and functionality after you’ve already gotten started. And the more you do it, the better you get.

Your mentor is an invaluable resource as you learn to plan and scope appropriately. They can help beef up your simpler ideas, as well as scale back your more ambitious proposals into something more manageable. Start discussing project concepts with your mentor as soon as you start a new curriculum.
