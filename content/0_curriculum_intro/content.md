At Thinkful, we’ve helped thousands of people gain new skills to advance their careers and so we’ve learned a thing or two about how students can best use their time to succeed. Before getting to the business of data science or even meeting your mentor, we ask that you carefully read through these orientation materials to learn the best strategies for structuring your learning experience.

We'll discuss how to get the most out of 1-on-1 mentorship and our learning materials, and how the entire educational experience fits together. As you go through this, write your plans and goals on a piece of paper or in a doc. These will evolve naturally over time, but let's get them on paper now.

Focus on answering these questions:

* When will I spend time reading the curriculum?
* When I run into difficulty, what are my options to get support?
* Am I prepared to deal with unexpected demands on my time?

During your first 1-on-1 mentor session, iron out your answers to these questions. Success requires clear goals, and a concrete schedule and plan to meet them.
