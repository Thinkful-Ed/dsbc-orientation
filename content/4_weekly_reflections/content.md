Having worked with hundreds of students in this program, we know one thing: the greatest challenge we face as learners is holding ourselves accountable. The best way to make consistent progress is to reflect frequently on your work.

Each Monday, you’ll be required to fill out a few questions to think proactively about your learning goals, work habits, and project management skills. You’ll receive an email from your program manager every Monday to check in.

#### What should I reflect on?

- What did you learn in the past week? Is there anything you wish you did differently?
- How did you divide your time between reading, project work, and other activities? How could you achieve your goals more efficiently, improve your process?
- How could the curriculum, the community, and your mentor have been a bigger part of your learning?
- Do you feel good about your progress last week?

#### Is this mandatory?

Short answer: yes. Reflections are mandatory.

Your program manager will read your reflections each week to make sure you’re getting the support and tools you need to be successful. Our PMs are vigilant! They read every response and will know if you haven’t filled yours out. Expect to hear from them if they haven’t seen your response by the end of the week.

Don’t take this lightly: Understanding your own progress is crucial to your success in learning data science. It’s incredibly valuable to understand your strengths and weaknesses, and it shouldn’t take you more than 10 minutes every week!
